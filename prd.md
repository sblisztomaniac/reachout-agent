# PRD: Agentic AI Outreach Copilot  
**API-Aligned with AINative Studio (v1)**

---

## 0. Objective (No Abstractions)

Build an **Agentic AI system** that helps freelancers and solo founders **discover, qualify, research, and reach out to businesses** with minimal manual effort, using **only existing AINative Studio APIs**.

This PRD is **fully realigned** to what is *actually possible* with the current API surface.  
No imaginary endpoints. No hand-wavy agents.

---

## 1. Product Definition (System-Truth)

**Outreach Copilot** is a **multi-agent workflow system**, composed using:

- Agent Orchestration
- Agent Coordination
- Agent Framework (Memory)
- Agent Learning
- Agent State
- Agent Bridge
- Auth + RBAC

The product does **not** invent new primitives.  
It **composes workflows** using existing APIs.

---

## 2. Target Users

### Primary
- Freelancers
- Solo founders
- Indie consultants

### Secondary
- Small agencies (≤10 people)

---

## 3. Authentication & Identity (FOUNDATION)

### APIs Used
- `POST /api/v1/auth/`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- `GET /api/v1/users/me`

### Role Usage
| Role | Purpose |
|---|---|
| USER | Run outreach workflows |
| ADMIN | Manage agents, debug, monitor |

All agents, memory, tasks, learning are **scoped to authenticated user**.

---

## 4. Core Product Objects → API Mapping

| Product Concept | API Primitive |
|---|---|
| User | Auth User |
| Outreach Campaign | Agent Sequence |
| Agent | Orchestrated Agent |
| Lead | Memory Entry |
| Outreach Draft | Agent Message |
| Follow-up | Task + State |
| Learning | Agent Learning Insight |

---

## 5. High-Level Workflow (End-to-End)

1. User logs in
2. User defines **Outreach Intent**
3. System creates agents
4. Agent sequence executes:
   - Discover → Qualify → Research → Draft
5. User reviews drafts
6. Messages sent via Agent Bridge
7. Replies + outcomes logged
8. Learning fed back into system

---

## 6. Outreach Intent (User Input → Memory)

### Inputs
- Services offered
- Target industries
- Geography
- Company size
- Outreach channel
- Tone preferences
- Daily limits

### API Usage
- `POST /agent-framework/memories`

```json

Output
	•	Company candidates → memory

{
  "type": "lead_raw",
  "company": "Acme Fintech",
  "source": "website",
  "reason": "Hiring engineers"
}

Stored via:

}


⸻

7.3 Research & Context Agent

Purpose
Understand each company deeply.

	•	POST /agent-coordination/messages

Output

{
  "type": "company_research",
  "company": "Acme Fintech",
  "summary": "...",
  "pain_hypothesis": "...",
  "outreach_hook": "..."
}

Stored using:
	•	POST /agent-framework/memories

⸻

7.4 Outreach Drafting Agent

Purpose
Generate personalized outreach.

APIs

Produces
	•	Email / LinkedIn drafts

{
  "type": "outreach_draft",

	•	Send via Agent Bridge

⸻

7.6 Send & Execution (Agent Bridge)

	•	POST /agent-bridge/message

Used only after approval.

⸻

7.7 Follow-Up & State Tracking

Purpose
Track lifecycle of outreach.

7.8 Learning Agent

Purpose

⸻

9. Memory Model (ZeroDB via Agent Framework)

Memory Type	Purpose

outreach_draft	Draft messages
outreach_outcome	Results


⸻

10. RBAC Enforcement

Role	Access

DEVELOPER	Debug agents
ADMIN	Full access
GUEST	Read-only

APIs enforce this centrally.

⸻

11. Error Handling (Product Level)

Handled via:
	•	HTTP status

	•	Retry at task level

Frontend must:
	•	Show agent execution status
	•	Never silently fail

⸻

12. MVP Scope (STRICT)

Included

	•	Purchased lead lists
	•	Fully autonomous outreach
	•	Black-box behavior

⸻

14. Why This Works (Reality Check)
	•	Uses existing APIs only
	•	Aligns with agent-first architecture
	•	Keeps humans in control
	•	Scales from solo to agency
	•	Zero reinvention of backend primitives

⸻

15. Open Decisions (Product, Not Tech)
	•	Email vs LinkedIn priority
	•	Pricing model
	•	Vertical focus for MVP
	•	UI abstraction depth
